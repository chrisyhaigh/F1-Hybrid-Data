# F1 React App (Work in Progress)

## Overview

I'm currently working on this React application to provide information about Formula 1 (F1), including details about drivers, races, and standings from the turbo hybrid era. The application fetches data from the Ergast API for F1 information and the Rest Countries API for additional data.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap

- **Backend:**
  - PHP

## Features

- **Driver List from each year in the hybrid era:** Profiles of F1 drivers & results.
- **Constructor List from each year in the hybrid era:** Profiles of F1 teams & results.
- **Race history & results:** Explore information about F1 races.
- **Championship Standings:** Check the standings in the F1 championship from every year since 2014.

This project uses data from the following APIs:

- [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) for Formula 1 data
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) for additional country information
